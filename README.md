# SideMenu And TabBar Exemple
In this project we will implement a starter application with Side Menu, Tab Bar and costum Popup.

## Side Menu
For this part we will use :
* [SWRevealViewController](https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController/)  witch is a UIViewController subclass for revealing a rear (left and/or right) view controller behind a front controller, inspired by the Facebook app, done right!
## Tab Bar
## Costum Popup
